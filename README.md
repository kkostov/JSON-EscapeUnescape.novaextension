<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "JSON Escape Unescape" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

## Usage

<!--

-->

To run JSON Escape Unescape:

- Select the **Editor â†’ JSON Escape Unescape** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type one of the following commands:
  - `JSON Escape` to escape the contents of the current document
  - `JSON Unescape` to unescape the contents of the current document

## JSON Escape

Escaping JSON converts a json object into a string by replacing all occurrences of a forward slash `/`. In addition, the process also removes line and paragraph breaks.

## JSON Unescape

Unescape converts a string value into a JSON object by attempting to parse it.
